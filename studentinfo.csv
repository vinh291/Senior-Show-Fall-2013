Its goal is to explain simple psychology facts through games and interactivity in which the reader builds their understanding of themselves and their connection to everyone else. It is a subject that IÍve always found much interest in. By understanding myself from a pure psychology level I have been able to relate much better with others simply because at that level we all share many common things. With the modern world changing into a world of connecting to others and where a job market is demanding interpersonal skill, having the ability to understand one another is growing. It is really easy to look around our society and point-out differences. In history these differences have been use as excuses to justify racism, segregation, class systems and overall a separation. ThereÍs a big disconnect between individuals in cultures and within the smallest communities. America, as a society, has vastly improved its stance on integration and acceptation of others. We as the current generations are shaping the future for generations to model us and learn from our mistakes. I believe if we educated ourselves to how connected we all really our society can foster even more then it has in the recent decades. With my research IÍve been continually amazing how our innate aspects transcend location, culture, age, and time. It doesnÍt matter where on earth someone is but place a snake in front of anyone and they will all have the same reaction. ThereÍs countless of other examples that show the many similarities we all have. I hope that my book demonstrates these and more while providing a fun read through out.",n,n,nSergio Balderrama,Design,sbalderr@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Sergio_Balderrama.jpg,"Bolivia: A Journalistic Perspective is a book that focuses on the culture and geography of the Andean country from the perspective of a family of photojournalists who have traveled to the areas described in the book and interacted with the people from the region gathering a true local perspective. The book relates what Bolivia is, not only from the content, but also from the design concepts used such as color schema, horizontal layout and integration of Bolivian materials.The color schema chosen for the book is based on the colors of the Bolivian indigenous flag called the &rdquo;wipala&rdquo;, which represents all the different cultures of Bolivia. The landscape layout of the book was chosen to emphasize the photographs taken by the photojournalists, which are also mostly horizontal. Bolivian symbols, such as the condor that appears at the bottom of each page was inserted to demonstrate important symbols of Bolivian culture.Regarding content, the book introduces various cultural aspects of Bolivia including the traditional ceremonies, holidays, and the customs of Bolivian people. For geography, it presents the climate and landforms that define occidental and oriental regions of the country and how these geographical differences impact the lives of the people who live there. Due to the remoteness of Bolivia, lack of infrastructure (such as passable roads) and lack of resources to invest in tourism, many of Bolivia&rsquo;s historical sites have not been exposed to the general public and are have been left untouched in many cases. This book gives the reader insight into several of these remote and untouched historical sites.",n,n,nShannon Brown,Design,sbrown18@gmu.edu,sbrown8910@gmail.com,http://sbrown8910.wix.com/portfolio,img/students/Shannon_Brown.jpg,"It is often intimidating to go out and buy a bottle of wine with no knowledge about what to look for or, how to look for it when making personal selections. If you don&rsquo;t know much about wine it is always easier to turn to a friend or expert for a recommendation but taste is personal. With this book you will gain the confidence and ability to select wine and be delighted with your results. Amongst many things, understanding what the information on a wine label means, and even serving etiquette are a few important aspects that any beginner should know if you hope to increase your appreciation and understanding of wine. The beauty in the variety of colors of wine, tastes, textures, and smells are all important when it comes to enjoying the full experience of wine and becoming involved in the social culture of wine.This book will mainly focus on wine within the United States but will also lightly touch on wine from different regions and countries. However, an interest in wine can also cross cultures, class, and has the capability of uniting people both in our modern times and throughout history. It used to be that drinking wine was only for people who were wealthy and well off but in current times, anyone has the capability of enjoying good wine, even on a low budget. This aspect is one of many that can bring people together through the shared interest in wine.By going to wine tastings, having discussions with my friends, and meeting new people along the way who share my interest of wine, I have been able to gain stronger connections just by understanding the lingo. Much of the book is spent on explaining the different types of wine and flavors but I also wish to highlight that terminology is very important with any aspect of culture in order to grasp concepts and properly express ideas. Additionally, there are coasters spread throughout the book that can be utilized as any owner of this book sees fit. Each coaster provided in the book contains three interesting or odd facts on the back can be used in conversation for future references. Wine Genie is a book that aims to guide any novice who is interested in learning more about wine. It provides the basics that anyone would need to know in order to comfortably and confidently make and discuss wine selections. Drinking wine for enjoyment is not only about selecting a good tasting wine, but also about using all the senses in order to experience the wine, learning where it comes from and how you can evaluate it based on personal preference.",n,n,nJohn Burrows,Design,jburrow@masonlive.gmu.edu,,#,img/students/John_Burrows.jpg,"One of the hardest parts about being a designer is explaining the profession to those who have no concept of the importance of graphic design. This book has been written to establish a basis of understanding of the many elements of graphic design and how they affect the viewer and to apply those methods in an exploratory reflective manner. Advertising is everywhere; it is as common as the air we breathe and the water we drink. Every day you are exposed to several hundreds of different forms of advertising. Whether it be a television commercial, print ad, billboard on your drive to work, a t-shirt logo; just these few instances have a weighted affect on a receiver &rsquo;s daily actions. Throughout the course of research, aspects of the subject I found most interesting include: effects of different colors and the responses they create. The differences between various frequencies of sound and how it affects your mood. How the various elements work together and market to the consumer on an individual level.In conclusion, this book has been written to help the reader understand the role that advertising has in the world and how it impacts each and every one of us. It not only markets a product to you but it also influences how that marketing helps to shape you as a person and your views on your place in society.",n,n,nBecky Calder,Design,rcalder2@masonlive.gmu.edu,,http://bexfx.com,img/students/Becky_Calder.jpg,"Pick This is a book highlighting major playing styles of the guitar and the most well-known guitarists associated with them. This book is aimed to teach beginners, be enjoyed by advanced players, and educate anyone simply interested in the subject of guitar. My guitar-playing journey started when I was in elementary school shopping for an instrument. The only thing that caught my eye was the purple EVH Wolfgang Special Edition hanging on the wall. In high school my love for music blossomed and ever since I set aside time for my Van Halen and all of his new friends I&rsquo;ve collected along the way. My book focuses on a range of influential styles. For example, the classical style can be used for some beautiful acoustic pieces, but also has been a major influence in the metal world. I aimed to collect styles that most people can recognize and relate to their musical interests. The major guitarists I have chosen to spotlight come from different time periods and geographical backgrounds. This shows that the love for guitar and its innovations goes back in time and all around the world. The most interesting part of the research was learning new things about guitarists that I admire and learning about new guitarists all together. I have a better understanding of the influence of different playing styles and I also was able to learn to play a few things along the way.",n,n,nRosalynn Cantu,Design,rcantu@gmu.edu,rosalynncantu@gmail.com,#,img/students/Rosalynn_Cantu.jpg,"There are times when you find a voice in the world that resonates with your soul. For me, this voice first found me when I was in my mid-teens; a seed planted within my mind that I dwelled upon every so often. As I grew older, and had the foundations of my very life shaken to the core by a traumatic onset of bipolar disorder and OCD, the voice called to me until I became enraptured by it. This was the voice of Carl Gustav Jung. I would never have imagined a man who had already left this earth could impact my views on art and life so profoundly. But his ideas have reached out to me from beyond the veil of time, enhancing the way I see the universe‹or perhaps he only helped me unlock just a few of its mysteries, many existing within myself.I feel that Carl Jung knew how deeply tied the spirit is to our physiological composition. They are in fact rather inseparable, as I have come to understand through his work. Where therapy had failed me during several years of tremendous mental agony, I found that through the Jungian lens, one can see the world as a balancing act of unfathomable forces that manifest through the psyche. In addition, I have learned that the universe is a myriad of symbols, woven together like a tapestry; these symbols, or archetypes, underlie everything and we interact with them constantly. It was with such perfect conciseness that Jung managed to categorize the nature of human beings, and our relationship to the collective unconscious.As I did research for my project, I read his autobiography Dreams, Memories and Reflections and felt myself growing closer to him. What shocked me most was how aligned some of our perspectives were, and the deep thirst for understanding Jung had during his life is the same that I have during my own. Jung was a man possessed by curiosity and was gifted with tremendous insight into topics that were dangerous to explore during his lifetime. His career prospered and waned, but he always followed his heart, even at the expense of losing friendships and academic respect. He treated the mentally ill, who were his patients with dignity and tried to understand them. If we all made this effort, I believe the world would be a much better place.I would like to invite you to take a journey as you explore this book. Please, take the time to contemplate these concepts. Allow them to plant seeds in your mind, to slowly blossom. I have tried to capture the essence of the Jungian ideas that have had the greatest impact on me through art and other mediums. Currently, we are surrounded by animation, video games, movies, books, and music of all different varieties. When we create and put forth our ideas in these various mediums, we are in essence collectively dreaming. I hope that as a race of intelligent, self-aware beings we can start listening to what our collective unconscious is telling us and evolve to a new level. I feel that many of Jung &rsquo;s ideas are rather simplistic, but I have condensed them nonetheless for those who may be unfamiliar with his work. My emphasis on art is due to my shared conviction with Jung that art is a gateway to the immaterial world and the mind. I believe with all my being that as we mature we come to embrace those symbols which help us best find our way through life. If we try to understand our likes and dislikes, our most cherished fandoms or favorite movies and books, we can look into ourselves and discover our true potential. It&rsquo;s my opinion that as active and bustling as the 21st century seems to be, we are actually slumbering away, dreaming though a giant looking glass.",n,n,nCandice Clark,Design,cclark20@gmu.edu,cnc492@aol.com,http://candicenoelle.com,img/students/Candice_Clark.jpg,"&rdquo;What you want to be from A to Z&rdquo; is a children&rsquo;s book that is intended to include a broad demographic of people who might not have a clear decision on their career choice. The purpose of it relating to children is to induce the sense of wonder and possibility within the world of what one can be when they grow up, whether they consider themselves grown or not. This notion is in keeping with my philosophy that, through exposure to the unknown, people will be able to expand their own possibilities. It is hard to imagine exactly what you can be if you don&rsquo;t know the possibilities of what exists. This idea relates to art and design because in my own work, it is hard to progress without research, mentoring, and critique from others. Creativity blossoms when someone isn&rsquo;t limited by what they know. &rdquo;What you want to be from A to Z&rdquo; is a child&rsquo;s introduction to the world of creative idea expansion, as well as an invitation for people of any age to explore professions society may not have geared them to.Traditional education methods are very linear and focused towards careers like doctors and teachers. Although those professions are very important, children aren&rsquo;t encouraged to explore their interests within society&rsquo;s linear style of education. My book promotes an expansion of ideas for both adults and children in a lighthearted manner. With the vast numbers of careers available, everyone, especially children, should be encouraged to explore, rather than be given a short list of professions to choose from. The value of this is that it promotes individuality and encourages one to explore the paths they are interested in. Too often children are molded into societal values and discouraged in their education to explore their interests. This leads to adults who aren&rsquo;t happy in their jobs and in the workforce. Although my book does not cover every profession available, it starts the idea-gears of what is possible.Along with broadening perspectives, this book is meant to promote childhood into adulthood literacy. In the growing electronic age, children aren&rsquo;t picking up as many books as they used to. The design of my book encourages interest in reading with the playful idea of exploring jobs through the fundamental ABCs. This will resonate with many age groups since everyone began by learning the alphabet. My book introduces the idea of stepping out of the mold for children, as well as reintroducing the idea of creativity to adults. During the process of writing and designing &rdquo;What you want to be from A to Z,&rdquo; I found that adults crave creativity differently than children do. My initial book was only geared toward children and their parents to promote early reading skills and undo educational limitations. After researching career paths and conducting informal surveys with various individuals, I&rsquo;ve realized that adults need just as muchif not moreencouragement to explore their interests. Answering the question &rdquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&rdquo; is difficult for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have guidance to explore their interests, so I discovered that my book could serve a duel purpose for children and adults.The overarching purpose of my book is to eventually promote individualistic learning within our society. Every person has a unique way of learning and within the style of education that is currently implemented, those who aren&rsquo;t good at tests fail. Children should be taught based on their strengths, which would eventually lead them to their ideal career. The United States was built on individual freedoms, so it&rsquo;s time our education system taught students differently. Although my book isn&rsquo;t intended as a political statement, it will address the need to allow children and adults to break from societal molds through creative thinking and literacy.",n,n,nIrwin Dejesus,Design,idejesu2@gmu.edu,irwin230@gmail.com,http://robotic-designs.tumblr.com/,img/students/Irwin_Dejesus.jpg,"People today rarely think about the history of video games even though they have been around since the 50&rsquo;s. The way we perceived videogames in society made a huge impact on our daily lives, revolutionizing not only how we specifically perceive graphics but also how we generally experience games. As I researched video games, I&rsquo;ve been struck by how drastically they have evolved from a gaming aspect to a real world application. Today, video game technology has developed from pixels to 2D art to 3D art to High Definition, while application has adapted from entertainment to a military training tool.I begin by examining Shigeru Miyamoto&rsquo;s 2D graphics in the Mario games, as they appeared in the late 1980&rsquo;s. Then I consider the 3D graphics of Mega Man and Bomber Man, and the way in which they paved the way for video games that can be played without a controller. However, video games really revolutionized society when they burst into High Definition. Games such as Gears of War, Halo and everyone&rsquo;s favorite game, Pok_mon, redefined the 90&rsquo;s, the early 2000&rsquo;s, and continue to impact us today. As I conducted my research, video games evolved from a flat art to a dimensional art, from a pixilated experiment to breathtakingly detailed experience. Today video games are used as a tool to train military officers to hone their skills in daily combat simulations through the use of video games. The military uses video games to capture the hearts and minds of possible recruits. In my research I have found that using video games develops a kind of decision making process that helps soldiers become better tacticians and strategists. The military used its official training game, America &rsquo;s Army, to rebuild its public image during the Iraq War. When the military was flooded with recruits in 2008, America &rsquo;s Army_sought to attract more skilled individuals.Today, video game technology has evolved to the point where we can use our voice and our body, instead of a controller, to play. This type of technology, Kinect, not only revolutionized how we play videogames but also we exercise. With this technology we are able to combine physical activities with entertainment. Video games have been around for generations and will continue to grow and evolve technologically in ways that will further revolutionize the society.",n,n,nAshley Folsom,Design,afolsom@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Ashley_Folsom.jpg,"As an avid Volkswagen Beetle lover and proud owner myself, the subject of this car&rsquo;s survival seemed the most appropriate for my senior book. The Volkswagen Beetle is one of the most recognizable cars in the world and we have all come across it at some point in our lives. Though anyone can point out a Volkswagen Beetle and punch their friends in the process (&rdquo;punch Buggy! No punch back!&rdquo;), many don&rsquo;t actually know the history of the car. It was designed during Nazi Germany for Hitler who wanted a cheap, simple car big enough for families to get around in. Ferdinand Porsche was called upon to design the &rdquo;people&rsquo;s car,&rdquo; with the design finalized in 1938. Hitler was inspired by the success of Henry Ford, with whom he shared a belief in the power of mass industrialization to improve society. The original plan for the car was that workers would put some of their wages into a savings plan and eventually be rewarded with this &rdquo;Strength through Joy&rdquo; car (as it was first known). Of course this just became another one of Hitler&rsquo;s broken promises, because when WWII began, everything was temporarily halted for the Beetle. After the war was over, the British military called for production to start up again in response to the shortage of cars in occupied Germany. Soon after, the Beetle became an icon of the country&rsquo;s postwar economic miracle. This choice by the Allied forces was the most important decision in the history of the Beetle; it was the act that allowed the car to survive. And now, the Beetle is the longest running car of a single shape and design, worldwide.In the United States, the Beetle was an icon for another reason. It was the car of choice for middle class America who couldn&rsquo;t afford the cars rolling out of Detroit in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. Typical American automobiles were made of eight-cylinder engines, generating more than 150 horsepower, automatic transmissions, air conditioners, and extravagant designs. For some American drivers, purchasing the mechanically simple, yet ultra-reliable VW was a form of consumer protest. The Beetle emerged as a symbol of individualism by the late 1950s. Many would argue that the car helped the automotive industry in the United States take off. The Beetle was an affordable solution to other models made in the United States, as well as something that was a little more stylish than the bulky cars made during this time. For a car that could have been hated by everyone because of its origins, it truly has excelled in many countries around the world. Today, the Volkswagen Beetle is still known as the longest-running and best-selling single car design in history. It is also the only car to have been brought back by popular demand, not once, but twice! Through all the years of its development, the basic look and feel of the car did not change, but the world around it did. We should be thanking the British army for demanding the production of the Beetle again, as this has allowed everyone to enjoy the Volkswagen Beetle for 75 years and counting.",n,n,nJennifer Gallagher,Design,jgalla11@gmu.edu,ciaoora@gmail.com,#,img/students/Jennifer_Gallagher.jpg,"Have you ever thought about the unknown and the stories behind them? Are they factual or are they fabricated? These earthly wonders are what fascinate me and I&rsquo;m sure for many you reading this. Cryptozoology is the study and the search of mysterious creatures that have been living among us, but are still waiting to be discovered. The concept behind the design of &rdquo;Legendary Sightings&rdquo; is inspired by traditional illustrative journals and catalogues, which identified and studied known life. &rdquo;Legendary Sightings&rdquo; will be a contemporary identification of cryptids with background information and theories about these creatures. Cryptozoology plays a role for many individuals and societies in the world. Many cryptids were discovered within ancient legends and mythology of an early civilization that has affected modern day people and cultures. Individuals and organizations, professional or not, have dedicated a majority of their lives in an attempt to discover such mysterious beasts. Though numerous times some cryptids turned out to be hoaxes, such as the jackalope, there are also some that haven&rsquo;t been found for centuries and are now just being discovered‹ like the giant squid. The creatures themselves also influence pop culture, where they play a role in movies, shows, games, etc. Cryptids play different roles for different people. To some they are legends, to others they&rsquo;re reality, and for the rest, they&rsquo;re an inspiration.While researching this topic there were a few aspects that were especially interesting to me. It&rsquo;s amazing to discover just how many people have dedicated their lives in seeking out these creatures that have been sought for many centuries. The most famous of the cryptids, Big Foot, who most professional cryptozoologists find to be a hoax or a misidentification of another known species, has such a large following that claimed sightings have been popping up all over America hundreds to thousands of times. It&rsquo;s mind-blowing to know that so many individuals and communities are in search of a single beast that many others think is a fabricated hoax.Cryptozoology was a remarkable and motivating subject to design and base my book, &rdquo;Legendary Sightings&rdquo; on. There are many unusual and extraordinary creatures found and fabricated through the minds of imaginative individuals that helped inspire me to consistently illustrate and write the entirety of this book. Though not only for myself as a designer, cryptids seem to also be an inspiration for many other creative people in the world‹ whether written or drawn. And as the years go on and more of these creatures are discovered to be real or fictitious, there will also be discoveries and fabrications of beings not yet imagined and that&rsquo;s something I believe we can look forward to.",n,n,nAriel Garcia,Design,agarci11@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Ariel_Garcia.jpg,"Today, the viewer is filled with different mediums of art to interpret. Film is a form of art. My three part book is about how the viewers interpret films differently based on cinematography, sound, and lighting. The images in this book are from the camera&rsquo;s point of view allowing the reader to witness first hand what they would see on the big screen. It is also an interactive book allowing the viewer to add and remove text to better experience an image. To further enhance the experience, the sound book plays music as pages are open. Even further, the light book allows the reader to instantly see the same images in black and white and color, or in different color tones all working together to imitate a real movie and intensify the reader&rsquo;s experience. Interpretation is an expression of understanding and making meaning. Its always subjective to the viewer &rsquo;s imagination and emotions.Our culture today is quickly moving towards a very visual and digital society:Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo, etc. Film has a great impact on society and universally,they address social and individual issues that are present in our world today. Filmscreate awareness of different topics of society: drugs, politics, education, art,medicine, etc. Different genres help awaken our sense of sympathy and empathy.Besides providing entertainment, films boost the imagination of aspiring youngwriters, and filmmakers to produce uniquely compelling and original ideas for theworld to witness. While the viewer interprets, the makers of a film are constantlystrategically, and sometimes purposefully (through narrative) culminating socialissues of day.What I found most interesting about the topic of film is that today it is most ofthe time viewed as negative. People always ponder on the negative effects it has on children and don &rsquo;t acknowledge the positives. Violence, sex, and crime for exampleare viewed negatively by parents. Parents believe that children who watching theseactivities will be influenced to do the same. However, I believe that sometimestouching those topics allow the viewer to think about the consequences and in manycases the moral lessons of a film with violence, sex, and crime are positive ratherthen negative. Yes, films have an individual impact and may cause a person to act acertain way. But films also provide positive examples.The merging of cinematography, sound, and light provoke an even greaterimagination and emotion in the viewer. Up to 80 % of all communication is nonverbal.Storytelling through visuals allows the viewer to have a more memorableexperience and convey emotion and imagination. Different camera angles not onlyestablish placement but also start from a close-up shot to an extreme wide-angleshot. Camera angles that are sometimes obvious and sometimes mysterious, allowthe viewer to be part of a film through their interpretation. Sound only enhances theexperience of a film. It subconsciously manipulates and guides the feelings andsentiments of viewers. Lighting plays a key role in the visual storytelling of a film. Agenre can be much more present through proper lighting. It also helps the viewer tofocus on different characters and objects. It sets the mood. The art of film providesthe viewer an aesthetic satisfaction, but most importantly, allows the viewer tointerpret the film with his or her own imagination and emotion.",n,n,nRaihan Ismati,Design,rismati@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Raihan_Ismati.jpg,rismati@gmu.edu,n,n,nGarwin Lien,Design,glien@gmu.edu,usogami@gmail.com,http://usogami.hostoi.com/project3/WebsiteScrolling/portfolio.html,img/students/Garwin_Lien.jpg,"Plants have always fascinated me; peonies in full bloom, their scent strong and sweet; dandelions that grow on lawns and sidewalks: the tiny blossoms often overlooked. The reason I created this book is not only to spread my joy and passion for plants as well as to show that the foods in a supermarket are only a minuscule amount of what is edible and beneficial. I also hope to give certain plants that are overlooked, forgotten, or hated, a new meaning. I wanted this book to have an earthy and organic feeling, to bring one closer to these plants and as a reminder that all known life comes from and will return to the earth.Today, few plants are remembered by the masses anymore, limited to the ones found in a grocery store. Oranges from Florida, peaches from Georgia, these fruits make such a long journey from where they were grown to end up in our supermarkets, and yet, growing between the cracks of pavement, is another, highly nutritious food. Instead of spending money on gas, water, pesticides, and sometimes genetics, for food, why not the plant that pushes through the pavement? The plant that grows despite having no human care for it, and yet manages to survive. Even now, the focus on food is on the exotic and &rdquo;newly&rdquo; discovered foods from places abroad, but what about the ones that grow in our backyards?While researching this subject, I found new ideas and information that have enlightened me to more questions. I found that the difference between what the FDA suggests as a fruit, vegetable, and grain to be based on consumer perception, yet what does that mean? Are the current nutrition guidelines based on something other than nutrition? In my opinion, this idea of having nutrition categorizes on something as ephemeral as consumer perception to be highly worrying. I found that many perceived weeds growing in Northern Virginia to be far more beneficial not only to humans, but to other living things as well.I have written about these alternative food sources so that people can re-evaluate their ideas about the plants they often overlook; to remember that all plants have their use; that the term &rdquo;weed&rdquo; is subjective and should be used as such. I have found that some so-called weeds should become a part of our diet not only because of their convenience, but also their nutritional and environmental benefits. I feel that in switching the focus to such plants, not only would America still have enough food for its citizens, but also help spread food to the ones who truly need food. Also, a new wave of research on plants not covered in this book would also shed light on a number of other plants that have not yet been studied for their nutritional benefits.",n,n,nRobert Nigro,Design,rnigro@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Robert_Nigro.jpg,"Since the mid 80s, the Japanese pop culture phenomenon has had a profoundeffect on the American animation and art industry. Infecting its way into every college graduate in this current day and age, Anime and the Japanese culture has redefined how professional artists view the 2d medium. The style of Japanese Anime is an idealized form that focuses mainly on slightly exaggerated realism mainly in the facial region. This exaggerated realistic form leads to many more unique and expressive characters that can retain a comic like feel but also the sense of seriousness to their over all look and design. Japanese Anime and Manga also had a major effect on what can and cannot be written as a story in both the comic and animation mediums. Japanese Anime and Manga broke new ground in this category of story telling allowing for a broader range of stories to be told and characters written from the journeys of someone through the spirit world to a simple slice of life comedy. This phenomena has grown in strength for the last 30 years bringing a revolutionary change in how most people draw cartoon character, view the quality of animation, and the topics of what could be written about in mainstream media such as comics and cartoons not just for kids but for adults as well. The visual aesthetic of how to draw characters have been heavily implanted into kids for years as they have found themselves personally effected by anime and as such imitate the style of drawing while they are learning to draw themselves. As a result of this trend most young and growing artists become more proficient in this style of art work and have lead to a dramatic shift in the visual styles of comics and cartoons as they themselves become creative professionals. The stylization of Anime can be considered the new Avant guard of this era of artists that furthers their creativity and allows them greater freedom and flexibility in their art. Most notable is the profound effect it had the creators of Avatar the Last Airbender which raised the bar on what was considered animation not just for kids but for adults and would become critically acclaimed by critics and fans alike. This revolutionary idea would inspire many other creators rethink their out look on how they created shows and would continue this new revolution far into the 2000s and beyond. The most notable animations that rose as a result of the effects of Avatar wasa show by the name of Ben 10. This show would become the first of many in the wake of avatar to take on the broader concepts of art and story telling for a kids show by borrowing from Japanese culture and designing characters around the idealized form in Anime. This show would be brought to critical success with over 6 seasons to its name with an established fan base. This trend would continue to build not just in animation but in comics as well. Starting with internet based web comics this style of drawing derived from Japanese culture became a wide spread virus that would condition artist to abandon traditional realism for the more abstracted idealized forms found in both Anime and Manga to further their own style of art creation. This school of thought became so widely accepted that it would eventually effect the ways professional comic book artists would handle their creations for large scale companies such as Archie, DC, and Marvel. The world of Anime and Manga has had a massive influence on the development of many young artists. Most young artists today got their interest and start in drawing from anime and manga and as a result, many of their developed styles reflect the Japanese influence. Anime has a massive cultural effect not just here in America but many other countries as well. Anime is not just a cultural fad but rather a revolutionary style that speaks across many cultures and further unities our world through a common interest.

Others, I have spent hours chasing kidsaround, pacing while try to coerce an infant to take a nap and to then just walk away and never see them again (sometimes by chance, other times by choice). The diversity in family dynamics and environmental factors always catches my attention, and I ask myself, &rdquo;How do these differences reflect on to the growth of these children, and what role am I going to play in this child&rsquo;s life?&rdquo; Day-to-day, we see children, and make judgments on their behavior, gauging their level of understanding, and how their parents/guardians are involved. However, I do not think we are really considering the steps it takes to get there and how their effortsnow, will influence the world later. After spending hundreds of hours with kids, and interacting with them (as well as their parents), I was interested to learn more about the different development models and milestones children are expected to reach. We are constantly enforcing or celebrating our differences and uniqueness but when it comes to the basics of walking, talking, even eating, we all have expectations. Caring for these kids I was interested to see the varying levels and ages of milestones reached and comparing them to what is expected from these models‹some hit every goal, while others struggle with some aspects but excel in others. The development model that intrigued me the most was the verbal/imitation model. From &rdquo;cooing&rdquo; and babbling, to one syllable words and then full sentences is something I have never really considered but can look backand identify throughout my experiences. I have collected a few stories; most are funny incidents about what kids have said to me about themselves, their parents, siblings and family members. Others, I look back on as tales of suffering. In the end, I found that each child hasa different way of expressing him or herself and what is around them, and how their nurturing now shapes what we can expect of the future.",n,n,nEllen Sung,Design,hsung3@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Ellen_Sung.jpg,"Gangnam style? This book is about Seoul, Korea. Seoul always trends everything first like New York. People visit Seoul more now than ever. While there they need a guide that has accurate information, info graphics, and a way of comparing cultures&rsquo; differences. The Seoul Korea travel guidebook is made to give more accurate information about Seoul and its current culture from the viewpoint of a native speaker. The design is approach is to show the reader colorful, eye-catching photographs on each page and keep other design elements minimal to emphasize the photographs more. The travelers have to know more about the culture of the country they travel. Korean culture is different from America, etiquette is a little different but the result may be very different. So this book will help avoid misunderstandings of the culture. Travel should only fun, experience new things, not confusion, right? Help to experience Korean culture that no only traditional. Seoul became a very contemporary city, which coexists with the traditional. Finally, Seoul is a very busy city. You can tell who is a traveler, and who is living there, because Korean people always have the busyness in their behavior, foreigners do not have. Government offices process speed takes a day or two, online shopping and shipping take two days are the maximum; everything is very fast. However, Seoul has various cultures mixed together, changing so much faster than anywhere in America. After reading this book, I hope people will want to visit Korea once, and they will want to visit again, and again. Seoul is following social trends so much, that even Korean visitors, who live in other countries feel it. Every time you visit Seoul, you will feel it is very different. ",n,n,nCorin Wilson,Design,cwilsonj@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Corin_Wilson.jpg,"Endangered animals are a growing problem in the world today. Most of the reason is due to humans with more and more people hunting them, cutting down their habitats, and polluting their land. People don&rsquo;t seem to pay attention to the little details of the world around them anymore and think that minor things like throwing trash on the ground won&rsquo;t affect nature at all. The world is more interested in technological advancement and building new inventions that take up so much land and ruin these animals&rsquo; habitats. Children today will never get to see and experience the animals as our ancestors did. It&rsquo;s important to start young with teaching children about these problems so that they can be aware of it and find new ways to protect nature and prevent endangerment. What I found interesting in my research is that endangerment disrupts our whole ecosystem. Some predators might rely on that specific endangered animal as their food source and in turn, it might affect that predator species as well. Once the cycle is disrupted, everything gets thrown off balance. We also lose opportunities once species go extinct. Much of our medicine is made from things found in nature. This means that scientists would no longer be able to do research that might be needed for making new discoveries and curing diseases. This book is designed to educate children about our crucial problem of endangered animals. Made in an interactive ABC format, children are not only able to learn but to have fun as well. The aesthetic of the book is more illustrative and colorful to appeal more to children because they are more visual learners and will lose interest with just all text and no interactivity. In turn, this entertaining format is beneficial because it makes them want to learn more about endangered animals when they&rsquo;re through reading.Overall, endangered animals need to be saved. The only way to prevent extinction is by taking some kind of action whether it&rsquo;s something small like picking up litter or recycling. Helping the planet will in turn help the animals. Starting early and educating children will be beneficial for our future generations. The more children realize the importance of this issue, the better our outlook is. If we could get people to respect and love nature, maybe something could start to happen.",n,n,nRobert Espiritu,Design,respiri2@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Robert_Espiritu.jpg,"Hardcore Punk has always fascinated me. Banned in D.C.: A Look Back on D.C. Punk explores the thriving underground of Washington, D.C., during the 1980s, giving visual form to the chaotic energy of the world-renowned punk and hardcore scene. The &rdquo;do it yourself&rdquo; mentality is an ethic that Punk culture utilized and I wanted to reflect that in my book. Keeping with contemporary layouts merged with the grunginess of punk gave me Degenerate haircuts, obscene clothes, and vulgar attitudes are a few words to describe the particular D.C. subculture. By the beginning of the 1980s a new more aggressive style of music sprawled across the D.C. underground, Hardcore Punk. Banned in D.C. tells a local history from a local point of view. Embedded within text is a collection of photos, flyers, posters, records, newspaper clippings, stage clothes, and instruments The title Banned in D.C. comes from D.C. Punk legend Bad Brains, known for pioneering Hardcore Punk on the east coast. From my research I learned that Washington, D.C. had one of the first and most influential hardcore punk scenes in the United States followed by Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. Friends would tell me of their encounters with different Hardcore Punk legends outside the 9:30 Club and how they would reminisce of moshing to Black Flag at the Wilson Center. Funny thing is I never listened to Hardcore Punk before writing my book, until now that is.My influences are first and foremost everything I see, feel, and experience, but I&rsquo;ve always loved music.

My interest in Filipino folklore is predicated upon the idea that these extraordinary manifestation&rsquo;s and stories have helped shape and transcend Filipino beliefs in the supernatural, that have been passed down from generation to generation. I believe that these folktales, illustrated in film and literature, can provide us with a sense of bliss and excitement or a feeling of fear and shock. Some stories concentrate on the positive elements while others consider the negative aspects in the stories, which allow us to deal with our darkest emotions and express ourselves creatively. The horror used in folktales is one way we can step outside of our comfort zone and into a world of unpleasant possibilities that we knew existed but were too hesitant to touch. I find that tapping into our inner demons and revealing them metaphorically through art and stories is not only healthy, but a powerful and a beautiful way to showcase ourselves and the world we live in. Just like in many other countries, the root of the Filipino folktale is transmitted orally; describing the lifestyle and beliefs of the Philippines. These traditions are rooted in the indigenous tribes and various ethnic groups where the mysticism behind the folklore is not only fascinating but entertaining. It is my belief that these folktales allow people to bridge the gap between various cultural differences such as, economics and social class to create a euphoric world for all readers. The stories within folktales challenge the norm and create a dynamic tension between mysticism and what is reality. Many of these folktales contain magic, mythical creatures, superstitions and references to the supernatural. They are used as a way to help people understand and make sense of the things that logic could not explain and are also used to entertain, discipline and deter children from getting into mischief. The Philippines is a country made up of islands which are divided into 17 regions creating a total of 80 provinces. Within these provinces there are numerous mythical creatures in every region of the Philippines that many Filipinos still believe in. The artworks and graphics that enhanced the mood and feelings of the stories gave me inspiration to create my own horror folktale about the Manananggal (a deadly creature in Philippine folklore). The Manananggal resembles a Western vampire which feeds off fetuses but also on those who are ill and vulnerable. I find it interesting that many Filipinos in these provinces and those living in the mainland, still to this day, collectively believe in folktales as a way to explain and justify karmic and paranormal activity.Overall the horror in folklore pushes the limits of our imagination and can be stress-resistant. It heightens our senses, gives us the strength to fight, it allows ourselves to get wrapped-up in it‹to feel vulnerable and stops the feeling of pressure and worry. Though folklore connects people to their past, it is a central part of life in the present, and is at the heart of all cultures‹including our own‹throughout the_world. For me, as a Filipino-American, I will continue to carry on these traditional folklore tales and share them in the future with my children and grandchildren. I feel that these stories have impacted me growing up and as the Philippines evolves from a third world country and becomes more westernized, it is important to share, preserve and remember these stories as a staple of Filipino culture and heritage.",n,n,nSamuel Harris,Design,sharri21@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Samuel_Harris.jpg,"Beer has been around since before recorded history. It &rsquo;s the third most popular drink in the world, following water and tea. Unfortunately, I hadn &rsquo;t given it a second thought until about two years ago. That thought led to a beer, and that beer led to alcoholism‹just kidding! It actually led to an exploration of what beer is when broken into pieces and put back together again into a seemingly infinite number of delicious combinations.Today, people hold festivals in its name and celebrate by consuming mass amounts of this carbonated godsend. While beer is often misunderstood as a ""lower class"" or simple alcoholic beverage, there are in fact over 100 styles of beer, each containing thousands of different beers with unique characteristics and flavors. This is possible because beer is comprised of four main ingredients which can be found all over the world. When they &rsquo;re put together, cooked differently, fermented differently, and mixed with a number of additional ingredients, beer can become an extremely complex wonderland to anyone &rsquo;s taste buds. Of course, that doesn &rsquo;t mean there are beers that belong at the opposite end of the spectrum as well. Cheap, watered down beer has its place in the world just like the good stuff. That place just happens to be around a lot of 20-year olds who are already punch drunk!From type to type and style to style, the aspects of beer that I found most interesting and had not known about before writing my book have to do with the brewing and production process overall. Usually, my research for pleasure included reading about different kinds of beer and running out to get it. What I hadn &rsquo;t learned about previously were the deep and delicate details on the step-by-step brewing process and how each brewer puts their own spin on it.Another great thing about beer is that while it &rsquo;s been around literally forever, it will be around pretty much until the end of forever, too. What &rsquo;s more, it will continue to grow and evolve over time just as it has in the past. Beer is wonderful because it tastes good. Beer is great because it makes people feel good. Most importantly, beer is amazing because it brings people together from all over the world. Why wouldn &rsquo;t I want to write a book on something like beer?",n,n,nVinh Le,Design,vle6@gmu.edu,vinh@vinhdesigns.com,http://vinhdesigns.com,img/students/Vinh_Le.jpg,"The topic of minimalism has always been an interest of mine because of who I am. Keeping things simple is the way I think everything should be. With everything these days being overwhelming, confusing and often times convoluted, I wanted to write and edit this book to focus on simplicity in all aspects of my life and how it can help others along the way.Applying minimalism in a modern world is a way of getting rid of unnecessary things that clutter and detract us from our own lives. This notion of freeing oneself is what has interested many from the past to the modern man. Being able to be truly free is something everyone wants to achieve. While it may be very difficult to achieve, there are steps that you can take to make it a reality. Keeping things simple is difficult in today &rsquo;s consumerist and information overloaded world. With all the things calling for attention, it is easy to get stressed out and lose focus on the the important things in life. Letting go of unneeded possessions and keeping the bare necessities is extremely difficult because doing so goes against the inclination of human nature and the goals of popular culture. Reducing the unnecessary is the key to the whole concept. People should define what things are cluttering their lives and eliminate accordingly to embrace the minimalist concept.It &rsquo;s intriguing to think about how many people have associated happiness with the number of possessions they own. Many people are guilty of this, as this is what our culture has taught and shown us since the Industrial Revolution. To help people reflect on how they can break free from this expectation and lifestyle is what this book aims to do. It defines and encourages minimalism without being forceful or pretentious. The goal is to educate people and help them make the next steps to improve their lives and see what minimalism has done throughout history, art and design. Clearing up misconceptions is also a major point in the book. Minimalism may be trendy and counter cultural to some but it really is about applying aspects of minimalism to your own personal life.Minimalism could be the key to a stress free life. It &rsquo;s not a one-size-fits all kind of solution and it won &rsquo;t happen overnight. But having fewer things to worry about, and give your attention to, and being able to focus your life on what counts is something that I would love to achieve. Minimalism can be applied to every aspect of your life, whether it be your day to day activities, relationship and for me, my design and lifestyle.",n,n,nMary Mcelveen,Design,mmcelvee@gmu.edu,mmcelvee@masonlive.gmu.edu,http://marymcelveen.com,img/students/Mary_Mcelveen.jpg,"Ever since childhood, I was fascinated by pirates. I spent my family vacations at the beaches in North Carolina, absorbing any information I could from the nearby history museums. I took pride in the fact that Blackbeard &rsquo;s severed head was hung near where I grew up in Hampton Roads, Virginia. Virginia and North Carolina have a rich pirate history, but where can one find it? With my book, I hope to provide a guide for a pirate lover like myself for discovering the history of piracy both locally and throughout the world.Thanks to Hollywood and various works of fiction, the modern perception of pirates has changed. The pirate as a murderous, infamous antagonist has been replaced by a romanticized character created to entertain. These fictional accounts have served to perpetuate myths about piracy and alter their image from its fearsome origins. This history almost seems forgotten, and now people sunbathe on beautiful beaches, not knowing they once were used to hold bloody pirate executions. This history was made right where we&rsquo;re living, yet some of us don&rsquo;t know it even happened.In my research, I found that pirates are present in every maritime culture. Ever since the first recorded documentation of piracy in the Mediterranean in the Bronze Age, pirates have terrorized the seas, amassed great fortunes, and cemented themselves into popular culture by inspiring stories of pillaging and terror. They have left a rich legacy of rebellion and lawlessness which should not be entirely replaced by Hollywood&rsquo;s version.To conclude, I hope that this fascinating history of piracy is not forgotten for the romanticized image. With this book, I hope to spur others into setting sail and seeking out even more pirate history. I hope to see more of the community seek out what history is buried around them, and take interest in less known landmarks of piracy.",n,n,nEduardo Pereira,Design,epereira@gmu.edu,dudubrasil@gmail.com,#,img/students/Eduardo_Pereira.jpg,"The 5 Senses of Brasil is a culinary book about Brazilian cuisine. As a Brazilian immigrant to the United States, and a food lover, I decided to write a cookbook about how Brazilian cuisine was influenced by other cultures. Very similar to my general philosophy as an artist, my intention with this book is to diminish the separation between different countries and to try to educate people about other cultures through my art and design work.After speaking with numerous non-Brazilians over the course of many years, it became very apparent to me that when people think of Brazil, they tend to only think about a few things; Rio de Janeiro, pristine beaches, carnival, and the Amazon rainforest. Furthermore, if you ask people about Brazilian food, most people would immediately think about churrasco, or the all-you-can-eat Brazilian style barbecues, which is not surprising since most Brazilian style restaurants outside of Brazil usually serve this type of food. In general, Brazil and its cuisine is a lot more diverse and varied than what most people perceive. My objective for this cookbook is to convince others of this diversity and to provide them with some recipes for dishes that they can make and experience a little more about Brazilian culture and its cuisine without leaving the comfort of their home. From a personal level, I certainly learned more about my own country and the influences that immigrants had on the food that Brazilian people eat everyday of their lives. Although I knew that immigrants came to Brazil from various different countries over the course of many centuries, I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate how many people actually immigrated and how many countries are now represented in modern day Brazil. Although immigration brought many different types of food and cultures to the regional cuisine where these different groups of people settled, the regional climate and geography also had a strong influence on the food that is eaten at these regions. Both of these factors have influenced Brazilian cuisine in a way that has lead to a melting pot of foods that is different from anywhere else in the world. In conclusion, Brazil is a country built on its own traditions but also welcoming of others, creating a cuisine that is distinctly local yet at the same time world famous. With over more than 500 years of history, Brazilian cuisine is the result of a great mix of traditions, ingredients and foods that have been introduced not only by the native indigenous population, but also the immigration that occurred in the same period. Each region of the country has its own peculiarities and its own gastronomic cuisine Due to the differences in climate, geography, soil type and vegetation, as well as different people inhabiting the same region, is very difficult to establish what might be considered typical Brazilian dish. The national staples are perhaps rice and beans, yet their preparation varies by region. However, mixing two ingredients so common on the Brazilian table, although its characteristic, it is still not enough to summarize the complexity and richness of the national cuisine. Ultimately, after researching, writing, and designing The 5 Senses of Brasil, I hope to convince the reader that Brazilian cuisine was formed, very much like the country itself, by a complex mix of people and different cultures within one fascinating and intriguing country, that it is still being explored today.",n,n,nKaitlyn McKenna,Design,kmckenna@masonlive.gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Kaitlyn_McKenna.jpg,"Society has created a vast array of idioms throughout history, compelling many and leaving others, such as myself, very confused on their origins. As a growing young adult and artist, I felt it necessary to dig deeper into the dialect of our world&rsquo;s history. It is easy to recite sayings that we pick up, but what do they truly mean? Beyond knowing the true meaning behind them, where do they come from?We, as humans, vary extraordinarily in culture throughout the world. Our dialects are not all the same, as well as our beliefs and moral structures. It is amazing, though, how in many different cultures and societies, we have the same idioms and sayings. We all erupted into this world in the same place at one point in history and expanded as the population grew. Our cultures and beliefs separated, as well as our countries. We broke away and became individual nations, but parts of us remained connected through language. Many of us use these intricate sayings throughout our everyday lives and believe we have a pretty good grasp on the meaning behind what we say. What is amazing, though, is that could not be farther from the truth. Many of the sayings that society has picked up and use regularly began long before our great, great, great grandparents were introduced into the world. Many of the sayings&rsquo; origins don&rsquo;t even make sense to an individual in the modern world! Yet it is compelling to read how long ago so many of these expressions and sayings began. Communication and language are the biggest connections that society still has. We vary so vastly in cultures throughout the world. We also vary extremely in language, but whether it is the same dialect or not, it is how we communicate with one another. While many individuals will use sayings that we think of as &rdquo;common&rdquo;, they are in fact ancient and tell of how they still connect us throughout the world. We have proven that even some three or four hundred years down the line of history, we still manage to use the same idioms that began with our ancestors. The sayings will continue on throughout future societies and gain only that much more importance‹an importance for the passing on of history through words, as well as importance for the connection of societies and language throughout our world.",n,n,nKatie Strylowski,Design,kstrylow@gmu.edu,katie.strylowski@gmail.com,#,img/students/Katie_Strylowski.jpg,"I love food. I love the sounds, the smells, the sensations and, above all, the tastes of cooking. As a child, eating food was always connected to making food: the peeling, roasting, whipping, tossing, and toasting always preceded the munching, licking, chewing, and smacking. But it wasn &rsquo;t until college that I discovered how the seemingly tedious task of preparing food actually heightened my enjoyment of the meal. This book is a testimony to that discovery. I &rsquo;m not alone in my new-found delight for hand-made food. Over the past two years, the creative online community has begun to withdraw from quick, easy consumerism and pursue meditative, laborious craftsmanship. They (and I) find the serialism of errorless commodities cold and heartless. We treasure the inherent humanity of handmade imperfections instead. We reject the blind business of constant virtual connection and cherish the purposeful slowness of analog tactility. This book wholeheartedly embraces this philosophy but I root my current interest in craftsmanship in my personal history. Before I jumped on the farm-to-table bandwagon, my mother was growing the lettuce for our salads and grinding the wheat for our bread. As I &rsquo;ve researched urban farming recommendations and tested dozens of recipes, I &rsquo;ve realized that preparing food is hard. When you &rsquo;re feeding six people, cooking can be exhausting. But I &rsquo;ve found that creating my own food is worth it. And it &rsquo;s not only rewarding because I feel healthier, brighter, and more alert. It&rsquo;s rewarding because sharing food knits communities together. There &rsquo;s nothing like surprising a sick friend with homemade soup, or bringing real cookies into the office. People respond to personally prepared food in an extremely authentic, intimate way. In an age of relationships mediated by online interfaces, memories edited by digital cameras, and experiences filtered through omnipresent smartphones, cooking provides a unique opportunity to share the experience of something real. I hope this book inspires my peers to find joy in hand-grown, handmade food.",n,n,nWilliam Wiard,Design,wwiard@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/William_Wiard.jpg,"Virginia is an interesting place to live.

Going to aquariums to be mentally, if not spiritually, enveloped in the world under water has been formative; I have come to more meaningfully appreciate the mysterious nuances of all life. As a result it has educated me on the dangers and perils humans inflict upon a world we take for granted, or don&rsquo;t understand, &rdquo;Out of Sight, Out of Mind&rdquo; speaks to all this.I believe the feelings of a place can be infused within a photo. Use of black and white on matte paper takes the distraction of color away allowing for the character and mood of the creature to be the focus. Not portraying this subject in a highly digitalized or glossy manner captures the ¥feel&rsquo; of walking through and underwater space. There is mystery and a little sadness about these fascinating, beautiful creatures. We dump and float our trash directly or indirectly onto and amidst them without a second thought. They are victims of an uncaring, selfish human populace and lack the ability to vocalize their turmoil.By representing a marine environment in this way I implicitly challenge unintended consequences, an ¥out of sight, out of mind&rsquo; mentality. It is my hope to slow viewers down and suggest their interconnection with, if not responsibility for, these underwater lives.Raised in Manassas, Virginia with a love for adventure, travel and the world around her; Dana Peters is a wandering photographer.

I strive to illuminate questions of the self and how they fit in the greater context of society. Whether influenced by cultural trends, my personal life, or current events, my work is an articulation of my response to and experience of the world. When utilizing a formal aesthetic, I wish to encourage further engagement through reflection, narrative building, and meaning to raise questions about contemporary social issues such as gender, class, and race, as well as how one positions themselves to &rdquo;the other.&rdquo; I believe that, by illuminating such socially constructed divisions, we may reach a greater understanding of the human condition.",n,n,nPilar Morfin,Photography,pmorfin@gmu.edu,,#,img/students/Pilar_Morfin.jpg,"There can be comfort in death - either literal or figurative - once we understand that it doesn&rsquo;t mean an end. Sometimes it means a new beginning. With &rdquo;Rebirth,&rdquo; viewers are invited to engage with forms which surround, comfort, and suggest a form of meditation.The materials, the relationship between light and dark, the images, and the environment work together to speak to potential ascent and to the required growth periods prior to it. The project reflects_a personal experience observing a loved one trapped in a deteriorating body, all the meanwhile his family watching him die within himself. In death, his spirit has seemed to return in other ways, reassuring those still here that he is free and no longer in pain. I feel a sense of ease surrounding this body of work as the whole experience inspiring it has reshaped my thoughts on birth, rebirth, and the changes we experience. Pilar Morfin is an artist whose use of organic materials and palette reflects an innate interest in the natural world, and our human relationship with it. Much of her process is uncalculated, allowing materials to act freely, and examining degrees to which nature can seem foreign, due only to our fallible understanding. Because of this, her works sometimes seem alien but relatable at the same time because they hint at forms we&rsquo;re familiar with. Developing alongside her film and alternative photography work is her exploration of large sculptural designs.

Essentially, this work was made to create a physical realm or shrine that highlights and documents this continuous passion. This three dimensional space that represents a guitar and its strings, acts as a home for woodblock prints that have been carved to represent all of the guitars he currently owns. Life, loss, and remembrance are constant themes in much of my work‹ it seems that there is a constant investigation into my own familial relationships and loss.

Most of the work I have produced over the last few years has been very introspective, concerned more with charting the evolution of my character and personality than anything else. With this new project, the goal was both to make something fun and entertaining, as well as serve a deeper purpose. It may be an artifact of growing up during the Cold War, and the immense sense of relief that followed. In the late 80s, when I was in High School, I honestly felt I wouldn &rsquo;t live to see 30. This wasn &rsquo;t because of anything I was doing, but rather the feeling that the US and the USSR were on a collision course that would end in nuclear war. After the Berlin Wall came down, and the fall of communism, things seemed to take an upswing. This was reinforced by the general prosperity the country enjoyed during the Clinton administration. As a result, as I passed through my 20s I started to slowly enjoy a longer view of life. With more time passing, notions of longevity began to occur to me more and more, and with it the notion that we as a people have a responsibility to not only be caretakers of the world we live in, but to actively try to improve it (or at least correct the ills we have inflicted upon it).A few years ago I came across an article that predicted a shortage of rare earth metals used in high tech electronic devices such as computers and cell phones. The gist of the article was that as these devices are becoming cheaper, the market continues to grow thus accelerating the rate that we are burning through these limited resources. As a technophile, this quickly grabbed my attention and drove home to me the need for recycling electronic products.This is what inspired the current piece. It is a short stop motion animation about a person and his pet in search of food. In this piece all the characters are clearly mechanical constructs, and their  &rsquo;food &rsquo; is simply a power source _ batteries. My goal is not to beat people over the head with a message, I hate being preached to and as a result have a tendency to avoid doing so to others. I would like to think that the underlying message is clear: if we do not start husbanding, conserving and recycling our resources the world will be a very different place for our children and grandchildren. Nobody wants their kids to grow up in a world that looks like something out of a Mad Max movie, but I fear that could well be the case if we don &rsquo;t start acting now to curb our  &rsquo;party now, pay later &rsquo; mentality. In short, the goal of my work here is to make a fun little piece that entertains my audience, and hopefully causes a few of them to rethink how they view the world.",n,n,nFiorella Galvez,New media,fgalvez2@masonlive.gmu.edu,fiorellagalvezco@gmail.com,http://cargocollective.com/fiorellagalvez,img/students/Fiorella_Galvez.jpg,"In life, there always comes the time where one should search. Search within; search to find that void in one&rsquo;s life. That one space we don&rsquo;t want to look, and that we want no one to find. Not even one can say that there is no void in their life, there&rsquo;s always one. If there were not, the world would be perfect, filled with whole and perfect people. This project is constructed on the basis of the search for a void, emptiness, or a hole that was left by the absence of a person. From time to time, there were instances of a void in her. Even though everything was fine there was something missing. There was an empty space; a space that she did not want anyone to find or point out. Many live with that space that weight heavily on one&rsquo;s shoulder. To some it consumes them, to others they learn to live without, or just ignore it. In this case, she wanted to confront it.To show the confrontation of the character&rsquo;s problem, I decided to make a short animation to try to best visualize the problem and its resolution. Using animation was the best medium to tell a short story. The story focuses on a girl that wants to confront a broken relationship. I am 100 percent sure that not all the relationships we have with others are perfect. This project will focus on a broken relationship. We have all been there, whether we are the person breaking the relationship, or the ones getting hurt at the other end. This relationship is not a relationship between lovers or friends. It&rsquo;s a relationship between a father and a daughter. Through this project, I want the audience to perceive the reflection of their sometimes hidden and broken relationships they have, either with their father, mother, or any other person. I want to bring that awareness to the audience so they can be moved to go and search, or try to brings things into conclusion, although it will not always have a conclusion.Fiorella Galvez is a New Media Artist who loves both Animation and Graphic Design along with Information Technology.

How to truly be unique and different.&rdquo;Define Yourself"" invites viewers into a private environment to encourage self reflection on originality. The space allows for a complete removal from distractions and societal repercussions that may lead to a biased reflective moment.What truly defines us€ what will we be remembered for decades after we pass, what sets us apart from the person to our left, to our right. Our name? Our likeness? Or our words. Our words can transcend time, can inspire, and can cause hate. Our words are what bond us and what make us different, what can free ourselves from this landscape of similarities.Being a twin, I live a constant struggle for originality. This is because I am not original on the surface. I may try to mask the similarities through clothing, but I will always be an appropriation, some part tied to the limitations of my physical being.True originality isn&rsquo;t appropriated, isn&rsquo;t altered. It isn&rsquo;t a shell of one thing that is caked over with something different. It is bred from start to finish from the eye of the beholder. Individuals have the aptitude to draw from themselves what makes them original, what makes them unique. Every experience, every decision, is a testament to the original life you live. I ask a question that can be answered with one word or without enough words. A question even the most enlightened will go to their graves never being able to answer. I ask a question that is as much a paradox as it is rational, a question with an answer, and without. But above all, I provide an environment for the exploration of this question and protection from judgment or distraction.",n,n,nGrant Sawyer Fields,Sculpture,gfields2@masonlive.gmu.edu,ohwoord@gmail.com,#,img/students/Grant_Sawyer_Fields.jpg,,n,n,nArthur Lugauskas,Sculpture,alugausk@gmu.edu,whereisarthur@gmail.com,http://www.whereisarthur.com,img/students/Arthur_Lugauskas.jpg,"concept, concept. what is a concept?

probably standing and thinking about this heading like i stand and think in front of walls when i do piop art on them. you decide to approach me and ask about my first ever five piop art walls that you saw during my senior art show at gmu. i kindly and, soon enough, passionately begin to speak and say the following:&rdquo;well, i didn&rsquo;t really know what i was doing. i kind of knew to an extent, but not fully. and i made up this term ¥piop art&rsquo;, which means ¥perspectives inside of perspectives art&rsquo;. i felt like that&rsquo;s where a certain kind of art i was doing fit categorically. and i actually got criticized for making up this ¥form of art&rsquo; and not fully knowing what i was doing. i was just being a kid, a creative, and having fun playing. and kids are the geniuses of todays day and age because they are everything and anything they want to be, they&rsquo;re honest, they say what they feel and what&rsquo;s real, and they&rsquo;re leaders of their own thoughts and ideas. and note, i have ideas of what those first ever five piop art walls are about. like, they are my thoughts, ways of looking at space, inspiration for literally anyone who gives them some time, etc. these walls are probably about individuality actually. or maybe they&rsquo;re more about you. choose to see what you want to see. which space do you want to enter? what&rsquo;s your perspective on life when you analyze these walls more and more? and listen, what i want is for these walls to help you in your life, help you connect dots like no one ever will, bring the most creative creativity out of you, give you ideas to help advance society, design, architecture, thinking, and ideas themselves in ways that have never been tried or looked at. and then at some point i realized that these walls are ahead of their time if i think they could do such an impact to any individual that confronts them. and i know i&rsquo;m ¥not supposed&rsquo; to say that out loud. because i guess it&rsquo;s an arrogant thing to say or it&rsquo;s something about ego or whatever. but, it&rsquo;s not about that. it&rsquo;s about being creative, shaping your world the way you want to, not following what you think you should follow because of ¥politics&rsquo; or ¥societal norms&rsquo;, and being individual and knowing that you could literally do anything you want in this world, call yourself whatever you think you are, and be anything. if you think of something or have dreams, don&rsquo;t be afraid to let your thoughts out and make your dreams come true. too many people are afraid. maybe they&rsquo;ll be judged, hated on, ridiculed, etc. but, don&rsquo;t worry. currently there are more dreamkillers than dreamers out there. and note, the dreamers are the ones who change the world. i don&rsquo;t want your dreams to die. and i&rsquo;m holding onto my dreams, but i&rsquo;m definitely getting beat up and talked trash about behind my back. i feel it. but, that&rsquo;s what happens when you speak truth. that&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re real. and it&rsquo;s not easy to give truth to people. but, it&rsquo;s also not easy to take truth. well, it&rsquo;s really all about perception. what&rsquo;s your perception of me?
